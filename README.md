I've successfully completed my first operating system lab assignment, focusing on the installation process of Windows 10. Excited about sharing my work, I've uploaded the comprehensive installation manual to GitHub. This marks a significant step in my OS lab journey, and I'm eager to make this resource accessible to others who may find it helpful. Looking forward to feedback and further contributions as I continue to delve into the world of operating systems.
